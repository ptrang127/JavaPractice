here are some key words and concepts to understand in java

===========
CHAPTER 1
===========

- class
a class is the basic unit of encapsulation. class name { }. it can contain methods and variables

- method
a subroutine in java. also known as a function

- public static void main(String args[]) { }
all java applications begin execution by calling main

- public
access modifier that determines how other parts of the program can interact with the members of the class

- private
an access modifier that only allows members within its class to access it

- void 
tells the compiler that nothing will be returned

- System.out.println()
System is a predefined class that provides access to the system. out is the output stream that is connected 
to the console. println() is a method

- int
variable to store integers (whole numbers)

- double
variable type to store fractional values

- if(condition) { }
a control statement used to navigate the flow of the program. if the conditions within () are true, the program
then the proceeding statement is executed

- for(initialization; condition; iteration) { }
this is a loop used to iterate through a loop control variable

===========
CHAPTER 2
===========

- boolean
represents true/false values

- byte
8-bit integer

- char
character

- double
double-precision floating point

- float
single-precision floating point

- int
integer

- long
long integer

- short
short integer

- +
addition

- -
subtraction

- *
multiplication

- /
division

- %
modulo

- ++
increment

- --
decrement

- ==
equal to

- !=
not equal to

- >
greater than

- <
less than

- >=
greater than or equal to

- <=
less than or equal to

- &
AND

- |
OR

- ^
XOR

- ||
short-circuit OR

- &&
short-circuit AND

- !
NOT

===========
CHAPTER 3
===========

- switch(choice){case break case break}
control statement used to execute statements based on a certain variable

- default
the last case

- while(condition) { }
while loop used to execute a statement while a condition is true

- do { } while( )
a variation of the while loop. ensures that the loop while always execute at least once

===========
CHAPTER 4
===========

- form of a class
class classname {
	type var1;
	type var2;

	type method1(parameters) {

	}
	type method2(parameters) {

	}
}

- object
an instance of a class created by
classname objectname = new classname(constructor);

- new
dynamically allocates memory for an object and returns a reference to it

- protected void finalize() { }
call a method to execute right before the object's final destruction

- this
keyword to pass reference to the invoking object

===========
CHAPTER 5
===========

- array
collection of variables of the same type referred to by a common name
type array-name[] = new type[size];
or
type array-name[] = {variable, variable, variable};

- bubble sort
a sorting algorithm that takes O(n^2) time and runs at best O(n)

- irregular arrays
arrays with differing dimensions

- .length
used to find the number of elements in array

- String
an object that contains a string of characters
immutable

- args[]
command line arguments
args[0] is the first argument

===========
CHAPTER 6
===========

- access modifier
member access control

- public
member can be accessed by any other code in program

- private
member can be accessed only by other members of its class

- protected
used in inheritance

- method overloading
when two or more methods share the same name but with different parameters

- recursion
when a method calls itself

- static
when a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created and without reference to any object
all objects share the same static value

- quick sort
one of the most efficient sorting algorithms

- nested class
a class that is a member inside of another class
an inner class can access the members of its enclosing class

- method(type ... v)
variable length arguments

===========
CHAPTER 7
===========
- inheritance
create a general class thatt defines treats common to a set of related items

- superclass
the class that is inherited

- subclass
the class that does the inheriting

- extends
the command to inherit
subclass extends superclass

- contructors with inheritance
super class constructor constructs the superclass portion
subclass constructor constructs the subclass portion

- super
a subclass can call a constructor defined by its superclass

superclass(int w, int h){ ... }
 
subclass(int w, int h){
	super(w, h);
}

super can also be used to access superclass members
super.membername

- method overriding
when a method in a subclass has the same return type and signature as a method in its superclass, 
then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the superclass

method overriding allows for run-time polymorphism

- polymorphism
when an object is able to take on multiple forms
dog IS-A animal
dog IS-a pet

- abstract class
a superclass that has a generalized form that will be shared by all of its subclasses
an abstract class can contain abstract methods
if a subclass inherits the abstract method, it MUST override the method

- final
used to prevent a method from being overridden or a class from being inherited
